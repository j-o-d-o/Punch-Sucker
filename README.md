## Running the Code
A running version of the code can be found at http://185.82.21.82/Punch-Sucker. But you can also run it on your own device. Simply fire up the index.html file in any browser that supports webGL. 

## The Game & Controlls  
The boring version (keyboard):  
Left Arrow => Move Left  
Right Arrow => Move Right  
p => Punch Right   
o => punch Left  
  
The cool version (webcam):  
Just lean to the right or left to move around in the respective direction.  
To punch, punch towards the camera (do not hit the camera, I probably should add a disclaimer ... ;) ).  
You can look at yourself by activing the debug layer (top right corner bottom icon). The red square shows the center of motion. 
Try to position yourself that your shoulders are a little below the half of the webcam window. When punching try to punch in the area left 
or right to your head.
